# CPU_Power_Modelling
# Power Modelling of ARM Cortex-A57 CPU on NVIDIA Jetson TX1

*******************************************************************************
# Step 1: Data Collection (Requires NVIDIA Jetson TX1)
1)  Go to Data_Collection/
2)  Run the makefile to compile the files: 
            make -f Makefile_cpu cpu_pow
4)  Run executable to start the benchmark run and collect data: 
            sudo ./pmon_cpu
5)  Raw data file is dumped: 
            power_measurement_log_a57.dat
*******************************************************************************

# Step 2: Post Processing (Offline)
1)  Transfer the raw data file (.dat) obtained in step 1 onto another machine 
    which can run python3.6 and bash scripts.
2)  Go to Post_Processing/
3)  Run the step which splits the .dat file into individual BM+Freq logs using: 
            python3.6 splitter_freq.py power_measurement_log_a57.dat
4)  Merge the files obtained in step-3 into a global log using: 	
	    python3.6 global_merger_nvidia.py
6)  To complete steps 3 & 4, there are separate targets within the
    Makefile_split_and_merge_new such as: 
            make -f Makefile_split_and_merge_new dir_0_cBenchtrain. 
    This will create a separate directory called run_0_cBenchtrain after running 
    steps 3 & 4.
6)  Run step 5 for all the required BM logs.
7)  Concatenate merged logs obtained for training set (cBenchtrain) and test
    set(cBenchtest) using one of the targets in the Makefile_split_and_merge_new as:
            make -f Makefile_split_and_merge_new create_run_0_dir
8)  The concatenated file is fed to the script in the modeling and validation
    step.

***********************************************************************************

# Step 3: Power Modeling and Validation
1)  Go to Modeling_and_Validation
2)  Ensure the following files are present in the directory:
	   build_model.m,
	   load_build_model.m,
	   octave_makemodel.sh (Make it executable using chmod u+x
    octave_makemodel.sh), and
	   benchmark_split.txt.
3)  Generate and Validate the power model by launching the command: 
            make make_cpu_model
4)  The model details can be output into an output log using the -s option.
5)  Use ./octave_makemodel.sh -h to open the help menu.
